## Individual_file_extraction.py:

This file allows you to extract the MDA text from an individual filing. It takes the path to the filing as input and displays the extracted MDA text in the IDE.


## Sentiment_analysis.py:

This is our first way to find a sentiment score, to use the code you need to input a clean MDA section to the function called 'evaluate'.
We first divided the clean MDA into sentences, then calculate the percentage of FLS to all sentences, and find a sentiment score of only FLS sentences.


## Demo.py:

An example code for 1 report for both 10-Q and 10-K with extraction and sentiment score.

## 2018192022 stats analysis
